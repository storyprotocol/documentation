As the steward of the Story ecosystem, the Story Foundation works in close alignment with $IP Tokenholders and the broader ecosystem. The Story Foundation supports the Story DAO by providing operational support, executing tokenholder governance decisions, and overseeing strategic development and growth of the overall ecosystem. This relationship is designed to empower decentralized governance while preserving efficiency and stability throughout the Story ecosystem.

Highlights of the Story Foundation’s role:

* Provide **strategic grants** to align with innovation via partner projects including, but not limited to, infrastructure providers, application developers, artists, creators, brand partnerships, creative studios, and strategic growth partners.
* **Promote network security** by creating a security council and appointing members to serve on this council.
* Developing the ecosystem and protocol by **implementing proposals** of the Story\
  DAO that are approved in accordance with the process outlined in the Story DAO Constitution and engaging parties to build apps. This may include funding research, public education, and establishing grant programs.
* Organizing **educational initiatives and hosting events** to increase awareness of and promote the Story Network, Story Protocol and ecosystem.
* Advocating for and **supporting increased autonomy and decentralization** of the Story\
  DAO.
* **Treasury management** and oversight to foster long-term ecosystem growth and support the Foundation’s ongoing mission.
