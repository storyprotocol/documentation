* **Promote network security** by creating a security council and appointing members to serve on this council.
* Developing the ecosystem and protocol by **implementing proposals** of the Story\
  DAO that are approved in accordance with the process outlined in the Story DAO Constitution and engaging parties to build apps. This may include funding research, public education, and establishing grant programs.
* Organizing **educational initiatives and hosting events** to increase awareness of and promote the Story Network, Story Protocol and ecosystem.
* Advocating for and **supporting increased autonomy and decentralization** of the Story\
  DAO.
