# What is $IP?

![](https://files.readme.io/cf2e1a0bff0a618c4527eb0c2992cfb916babb3674e3a15e3d6167274af9cd3b-image.png)

$IP is the native token of Story’s Layer 1 blockchain. It serves multiple critical functions across the network.

## Core Utilities of $IP

1. **Stake $IP to secure the network** – Validators stake $IP to maintain blockchain security and integrity in Story’s Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism.
2. **Transact on Story with $IP as gas** – All transactions on Story require $IP as the gas token, ensuring sustained network operations.
3. **Govern the $IP ecosystem** – Token holders participate in governance decisions, steering the future of Story’s onchain intellectual property market.

## $IP Distribution

58.4% of $IP is devoted to Ecosystem and Community, Foundation, and Initial Incentives.

The Community will be unlocked on Day 1 of Public Mainnet via our Initial Incentives claim. Early Backers and Core Contributors remain locked, with unlocks occurring over 48 months.

## Staking Fair Launch

Unlike previous launches that unfairly benefited insiders with regard to staking rewards, $IP staking follows a **fair launch principle**:

**There are no early staking rewards for the foundation or early contributors –** the community earns rewards simultaneously with everyone else.

During the **Singularity Period**, which lasts approximately 42 days after our January 19, 2025 genesis block 0, everyone is welcome to stake or delegate—but no staking rewards will be earned. This procedure offers everyone a chance to decide to stake.

After the Big Bang event, which concludes the Singularity Period, everyone will fairly earn staking rewards at the same time.
