Story provides a versatile framework to manage the entire lifecycle of IP development, enabling features like provenance, contribution tracking, frictionless licensing, and revenue sharing. The protocol has been designed with modularity and extensibility in mind, allowing developers to build a diverse array of applications on top of it, including generative AI, fandom platforms, gaming, franchise management, DeFi, social media, and DAO.

The [Story Explorer](https://explorer.story.foundation/) provides a comprehensive view of transactions on-chain and is there to assist in debugging during development.

Additionally, we are sharing some applications that can be built under the ecosystem, and you are welcome to share your bold ideas and applications built with Story Protocol.
