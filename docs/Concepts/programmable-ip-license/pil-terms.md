# On-chain terms

Most PIL terms are on-chain. They are implemented in the `IPILicenseTemplate.sol` contract as a `PILTerms` struct [here](https://github.com/storyprotocol/protocol-core-v1/blob/main/contracts/interfaces/modules/licensing/IPILicenseTemplate.sol).

```sol IPILicenseTemplate.sol
/// @notice This struct defines the terms for a Programmable IP License (PIL).
/// These terms can be attached to IP Assets.
struct PILTerms {
  bool transferable;
  address royaltyPolicy;
  uint256 defaultMintingFee;
  uint256 expiration;
  bool commercialUse;
  bool commercialAttribution;
  address commercializerChecker;
  bytes commercializerCheckerData;
  uint32 commercialRevShare;
  uint256 commercialRevCeiling;
  bool derivativesAllowed;
  bool derivativesAttribution;
  bool derivativesApproval;
  bool derivativesReciprocal;
  uint256 derivativeRevCeiling;
  address currency;
  string uri;
}
```

# Off-chain terms to be included in `uri` field

Some PIL terms must be stored off-chain and passed in the `uri` field above. This is because these terms are often more lengthy and/or descriptive, so it would not make sense to store them on-chain.
