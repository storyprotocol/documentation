In this tutorial, you will learn how to send money ("tip") an IP Asset using the TypeScript SDK.

## The Explanation

In this scenario, let's say there is a parent IP Asset that represents Mickey Mouse. Someone else draws a hat on that Mickey Mouse and registers it as a derivative (or "child") IP Asset. The License Terms specify that the child must share 50% of all commercial revenue (`commercialRevShare = 50`) with the parent. Someone else (a 3rd party user) comes along and wants to send the derivative 2 $WIP for being really cool.

For the purposes of this example, we will assume the child is already registered as a derivative IP Asset. If you want help learning this, check out [Register a Derivative](doc:register-a-derivative).

* Parent IP ID: `0x42595dA29B541770D9F9f298a014bF912655E183`
* Child IP ID: `0xeaa4Eed346373805B377F5a4fe1daeFeFB3D182a`

## 0. Before you Start

There are a few steps you have to complete before you can start the tutorial.

1. You will need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) and [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm). If you've coded before, you likely have these.
2. Add your Story Network Testnet wallet's private key to `.env` file:

```text env
WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY=<YOUR_WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY>
```

3. Add your preferred RPC URL to your `.env` file. You can just use the public default one we provide:

```text env
RPC_PROVIDER_URL=https://aeneid.storyrpc.io
```

4. Install the dependencies:

```Text Terminal
npm install @story-protocol/core-sdk viem
```

## 1. Set up your Story Config

In a `utils.ts` file, add the following code to set up your Story Config:

* Associated docs: [TypeScript SDK Setup](doc:typescript-sdk-setup)

```typescript utils.ts
import { StoryClient, StoryConfig } from '@story-protocol/core-sdk'
import { http } from 'viem'
import { privateKeyToAccount, Address, Account } from 'viem/accounts'

const privateKey: Address = `0x${process.env.WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY}`
export const account: Account = privateKeyToAccount(privateKey)

const config: StoryConfig = {  
  account: account,  
  transport: http(process.env.RPC_PROVIDER_URL),  
  chainId: 'aeneid',  
}  
export const client = StoryClient.newClient(config)
```

## 2. Tipping the Derivative IP Asset

Now create a `main.ts` file. We will use the `payRoyaltyOnBehalf` function to pay the derivative asset.

You will be paying the IP Asset with [$WIP](https://aeneid.storyscan.xyz/address/0x1514000000000000000000000000000000000000). **Note that if you don't have enough $WIP, the function will auto wrap an equivalent amount of $IP into $WIP for you.** If you don't have enough of either, it will fail.

> ðŸ“˜ Whitelisted Revenue Tokens
>
> Only tokens that are whitelisted by our protocol can be used as payment ("revenue") tokens. $WIP is one of those tokens. To see that list, go [here](https://docs.story.foundation/docs/deployed-smart-contracts#/).

Now we can call the `payRoyaltyOnBehalf` function. In this case:

1. `receiverIpId` is the `ipId` of the derivative (child) asset
2. `payerIpId` is `zeroAddress` because the payer is a 3rd party (someone that thinks Mickey Mouse with a hat on him is cool), and not necessarily another IP Asset
3. `token` is the address of $WIP, which can be found [here](https://docs.story.foundation/docs/ip-royalty-vault#whitelisted-revenue-tokens)
4. `amount` is 2, since the person tipping wants to send 2 $WIP

```typescript main.ts
import { client } from './utils'
import { zeroAaddress } from 'viem'

async function main() {
   const response = await client.royalty.payRoyaltyOnBehalf({
    receiverIpId: '0xeaa4Eed346373805B377F5a4fe1daeFeFB3D182a',
    payerIpId: zeroAddress,
    token: '0x1514000000000000000000000000000000000000',
    amount: 2,
    txOptions: { waitForTransaction: true },
  })
  console.log(`Paid royalty at transaction hash ${response.txHash}`) 
}

main();
```

## 3. Child Claiming Due Revenue

At this point we have already finished the tutorial: we learned how to tip an IP Asset. But what if the child and parent want to claim their due revenue?

The child has been paid 2 $WIP. But remember, it shares 50% of its revenue with the parent IP because of the `commercialRevenue = 50` in the license terms.

The child IP can claim its 1 $WIP by calling the `claimAllRevenue` function:

* `ancestorIpId` is the `ipId` of the IP Asset thats associated with the royalty vault that has the funds in it (more simply, this is just the child's `ipId`)
* `currencyTokens` is an array that contains the address of $WIP, which can be found [here](https://docs.story.foundation/docs/ip-royalty-vault#whitelisted-revenue-tokens)
* `claimer` is the address that holds the royalty tokens associated with the child's [IP Royalty Vault](doc:ip-royalty-vault). By default, they are in the IP Account, which is just the `ipId` of the child asset

```typescript main.ts
import { client } from './utils'
import { zeroAaddress } from 'viem'

async function main() {
  // previous code here ...
  const response = await client.royalty.claimAllRevenue({
    ancestorIpId: '0xDa03c4B278AD44f5a669e9b73580F91AeDE0E3B2',
    claimer: '0xDa03c4B278AD44f5a669e9b73580F91AeDE0E3B2',
    currencyTokens: ['0x1514000000000000000000000000000000000000'],
    childIpIds: [],
    royaltyPolicies: []
  })

  console.log(`Claimed revenue: ${response.claimedTokens}`);
}

main();
```

## 4. Parent Claiming Due Revenue

Continuing, the parent should be able to claim its revenue as well. In this example, the parent should be able to claim 1 $WIP since the child earned 2 $WIP and the `commercialRevShare = 50` in the license terms.

We will use the `claimAllRevenue` function to claim the due revenue tokens.

1. `ancestorIpId` is the `ipId` of the parent ("ancestor") asset
2. `claimer` is the address that holds the royalty tokens associated with the parent's [IP Royalty Vault](doc:ip-royalty-vault). By default, they are in the IP Account, which is just the `ipId` of the parent asset
3. `childIpIds` will have the `ipId` of the child asset
4. `royaltyPolicies` will contain the address of the royalty policy. As explained in [ðŸ’¸ Royalty Module](doc:royalty-module), this is either `RoyaltyPolicyLAP` or `RoyaltyPolicyLRP`, depending on the license terms. In this case, let's assume the license terms specify a `RoyaltyPolicyLAP`. Simply go to [Deployed Smart Contracts](doc:deployed-smart-contracts) and find the correct address.
5. `currencyTokens` is an array that contains the address of $WIP, which can be found [here](https://docs.story.foundation/docs/ip-royalty-vault#whitelisted-revenue-tokens)

```typescript main.ts
import { client } from './utils'
import { zeroAaddress } from 'viem'

async function main() {
  // previous code here ...

  const response = await client.royalty.claimAllRevenue({
    ancestorIpId: '0x089d75C9b7E441dA3115AF93FF9A855BDdbfe384',
    claimer: '0x089d75C9b7E441dA3115AF93FF9A855BDdbfe384',
    currencyTokens: ['0x1514000000000000000000000000000000000000'],
    childIpIds: ['0xDa03c4B278AD44f5a669e9b73580F91AeDE0E3B2'],
    royaltyPolicies: ['0xBe54FB168b3c982b7AaE60dB6CF75Bd8447b390E']
  })
  
  console.log(`Claimed revenue: ${response.claimedTokens}`);
}

main();
```
