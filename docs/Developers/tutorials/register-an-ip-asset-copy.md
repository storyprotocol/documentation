[PiPi](https://pfp3.io/pipi/mint) is a free generative pfp project on Story that lets you mint derivative artworks of [Ippy](https://explorer.story.foundation/ipa/0xB1D831271A68Db5c18c8F0B69327446f7C8D0A42), Story's official mascot. Ippy has [Non-Commercial Social Remixing (NCSR)](https://docs.story.foundation/docs/pil-flavors#flavor-1-non-commercial-social-remixing) terms attached, which means anyone can use it or create derivative works as long as it's not used commercially and proper attribution is shown.

When a PiPi is linked as a derivative of Ippy, it automatically inherits the same license terms (NCSR), and is linked in its ancestry graph, which you can see directly on our explorer.

In the following tutorial, you will learn how exactly these PiPi images were properly registered as derivatives of the official Ippy IP.
