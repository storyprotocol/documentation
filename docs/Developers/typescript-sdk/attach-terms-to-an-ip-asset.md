This section demonstrates how to attach [License Terms](doc:license-terms) to an [ðŸ§© IP Asset](doc:ip-asset). By attaching terms, users can publicly mint [License Tokens](doc:license-token) (the on-chain "license") with those terms from the IP.

### :warning: Prerequisites

There are a few steps you have to complete before you can start the tutorial.

1. Complete the [TypeScript SDK Setup](doc:typescript-sdk-setup)

## 0. Before We Start

We should mention that you do not need an existing IP Asset to attach terms to it. There are two functions you can use that allow you to **register IP + create terms + attach terms** in the same function:

* [mintAndRegisterIpAssetWithPilTerms](https://docs.story.foundation/docs/sdk-ipasset#/mintandregisteripassetwithpilterms)
* [registerIpAndAttachPilTerms](https://docs.story.foundation/docs/sdk-ipasset#/registeripandattachpilterms)

## 1. Register License Terms

In order to attach terms to an IP Asset, let's first create them!

[License Terms](doc:license-terms) are a configurable set of values that define restrictions on licenses minted from your IP that have those terms. For example, "If you mint this license, you must share 50% of your revenue with me." You can view the full set of terms in [PIL Terms](doc:pil-terms).

> ðŸ“˜ Duplicate Terms
>
> If License Terms already exist for the identical set of parameters you intend to create, it is unnecessary to create it again and the function will simply return the existing `licenseTermsId` and an undefined `txHash`. You can use existing License Terms by its `licenseTermsId`.

Below is a code example showing how to create new terms:

```typescript main.ts
import { LicenseTerms } from '@story-protocol/core-sdk';
import { zeroAddress } from 'viem';
// you should already have a client set up (prerequisite)
import { client } from './utils';

async function main() {
  const licenseTerms: LicenseTerms = {
    defaultMintingFee: 0n,
    // insert $WIP address from https://docs.story.foundation/docs/deployed-smart-contracts
    currency: '0x1514000000000000000000000000000000000000',
    // insert RoyaltyPolicyLAP address from https://docs.story.foundation/docs/deployed-smart-contracts
    royaltyPolicy: '0xBe54FB168b3c982b7AaE60dB6CF75Bd8447b390E',
    transferable: false,
    expiration: 0n,
    commercialUse: false,
    commercialAttribution: false,
    commercializerChecker: zeroAddress,
    commercializerCheckerData: '0x',
    commercialRevShare: 0,
    commercialRevCeiling: 0n,
    derivativesAllowed: false,
    derivativesAttribution: false,
    derivativesApproval: false,
    derivativesReciprocal: false,
    derivativeRevCeiling: 0n,
    uri: '',
  }

  const response = await client.license.registerPILTerms({ 
    ...licenseTerms, 
    txOptions: { waitForTransaction: true } 
  })

  console.log(`PIL Terms registered at transaction hash ${response.txHash}, License Terms ID: ${response.licenseTermsId}`)  
}

main();
```
```typescript Request Type
export type RegisterPILTermsRequest = Omit<
  LicenseTerms,
  "defaultMintingFee" | "expiration" | "commercialRevCeiling" | "derivativeRevCeiling"
> & {
  defaultMintingFee: bigint | string | number;
  expiration: bigint | string | number;
  commercialRevCeiling: bigint | string | number;
  derivativeRevCeiling: bigint | string | number;
  txOptions?: TxOptions;
};

export type LicenseTerms = {
  /*Indicates whether the license is transferable or not.*/
  transferable: boolean;
  /*The address of the royalty policy contract which required to StoryProtocol in advance.*/
  royaltyPolicy: Address;
  /*The default minting fee to be paid when minting a license.*/
  defaultMintingFee: bigint;
  /*The expiration period of the license.*/
  expiration: bigint;
  /*Indicates whether the work can be used commercially or not.*/
  commercialUse: boolean;
  /*Whether attribution is required when reproducing the work commercially or not.*/
  commercialAttribution: boolean;
  /*Commercializers that are allowed to commercially exploit the work. If zero address, then no restrictions is enforced.*/
  commercializerChecker: Address;
  /*The data to be passed to the commercializer checker contract.*/
  commercializerCheckerData: Address;
  /*Percentage of revenue that must be shared with the licensor.*/
  commercialRevShare: number;
  /*The maximum revenue that can be generated from the commercial use of the work.*/
  commercialRevCeiling: bigint;
  /*Indicates whether the licensee can create derivatives of his work or not.*/
  derivativesAllowed: boolean;
  /*Indicates whether attribution is required for derivatives of the work or not.*/
  derivativesAttribution: boolean;
  /*Indicates whether the licensor must approve derivatives of the work before they can be linked to the licensor IP ID or not.*/
  derivativesApproval: boolean;
  /*Indicates whether the licensee must license derivatives of the work under the same terms or not.*/
  derivativesReciprocal: boolean;
  /*The maximum revenue that can be generated from the derivative use of the work.*/
  derivativeRevCeiling: bigint;
  /*The ERC20 token to be used to pay the minting fee. the token must be registered in story protocol.*/
  currency: Address;
  /*The URI of the license terms, which can be used to fetch the offchain license terms.*/
  uri: string;
};
```
```typescript Response Type
export type RegisterPILResponse = {
  licenseTermsId?: bigint;
  txHash?: string;
  encodedTxData?: EncodedTxData;
};
```

### 1a. :icecream: PIL Flavors

As you see above, you have to choose between a lot of terms.

We have convenience functions to help you register new terms. We have created [PIL Flavors](doc:pil-flavors), which are pre-configured popular combinations of License Terms to help you decide what terms to use. You can view those PIL Flavors and then register terms using the following convenience functions:

<Cards columns={4}>
  <Card title="Non-Commercial Social Remixing" href="https://docs.story.foundation/docs/pil-flavors#/flavor-1-non-commercial-social-remixing" icon="fa-file" target="_blank">

  </Card>

  <Card title="Commercial Use" href="https://docs.story.foundation/docs/pil-flavors#/flavor-2-commercial-use" icon="fa-file" target="_blank">
    Pay to use the license with attribution, but don't have to share revenue.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Commercial Remix" href="https://docs.story.foundation/docs/pil-flavors#/flavor-3-commercial-remix" icon="fa-file" target="_blank">

    Free remixing and commercial use with attribution.
  </Card>
</Cards>

## 2. Attach License Terms

Now that we have created terms and have the associated `licenseTermsId`, we can attach them to an existing IP Asset like so:

```typescript TypeScript
import { LicenseTerms } from '@story-protocol/core-sdk';
import { zeroAddress } from 'viem';
// you should already have a client set up (prerequisite)
import { client } from './utils';

async function main() {
  // previous code here ...
  
  const response = await client.license.attachLicenseTerms({
    // insert your newly created license terms id here
    licenseTermsId: LICENSE_TERMS_ID, 
    // insert the ipId you want to attach terms to here
    ipId: "0x4c1f8c1035a8cE379dd4ed666758Fb29696CF721",
    txOptions: { waitForTransaction: true }
  });

  if (response.success) {
    console.log(`Attached License Terms to IPA at transaction hash ${response.txHash}.`)
  } else {
    console.log(`License Terms already attached to this IPA.`)
  }
}

main();
```
```typescript Request Type
export type AttachLicenseTermsRequest = {
  ipId: Address;
  licenseTermsId: string | number | bigint;
  licenseTemplate?: Address;
  txOptions?: TxOptions;
};
```
```typescript Response Type
export type AttachLicenseTermsResponse = {
  txHash?: string;
  encodedTxData?: EncodedTxData;
  success?: boolean;
};
```

### 2a. Create Terms + Attach

It's worth mentioning that you can **create terms + attach terms** all in the same step with the the [registerPilTermsAndAttach](https://docs.story.foundation/docs/sdk-ipasset#/registerpiltermsandattach) function. Whatever is easiest for you!

And, like we mentioned at the beginning, there are two functions you can use that allow you to **register IP + create terms + attach terms** in the same function:

* [mintAndRegisterIpAssetWithPilTerms](https://docs.story.foundation/docs/sdk-ipasset#/mintandregisteripassetwithpilterms)
* [registerIpAndAttachPilTerms](https://docs.story.foundation/docs/sdk-ipasset#/registeripandattachpilterms)
