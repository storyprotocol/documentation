Welcome to the hub for Story Network, the Story Chain. The aim of this section is to support you understand the fundamental of Story. Here we splited the content into two parts, understanding the architecture and operation a node.

If you are looking to understand more about the general design of Story node please take a look at [Node Architecture](doc:story-node-structure)

If you are looking to operate your node please take a look at [Operating a node](doc:operating-a-node)

If you are looking to become a validator please take a look at [Become a validator](doc:become-a-validator)

# Story Network (L1)

Story Network is a purpose-built layer 1 blockchain that combines the best of EVM and Cosmos SDK. It offers 100% EVM compatibility alongside deep execution layer optimizations to support graph data structures, specifically designed for handling complex IP data structures efficiently and cost-effectively.

## Key Features

- **EVM Compatibility**: Full compatibility with Ethereum Virtual Machine
- **Optimized Data Structures**: Precompiled primitives for efficient IP graph traversal
- **Fast Finality**: CometBFT-based consensus layer for quick transaction finality
- **Modular Architecture**: Decoupled consensus from execution using Ethereum's Engine-API
