# Story Network (L1)

Welcome to the Hub for Story Network, the Story Chain.

This section is designed to help you understand the fundamentals of Story Network. Weâ€™ve structured the content into two parts:

1. Understanding the Architecture
2. Operating a Node

Story Network is a purpose-built Layer 1 blockchain that seamlessly integrates the best of both the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and Cosmos SDK. It offers full EVM compatibility while incorporating deep execution layer optimizations to efficiently support graph-based data structures. These optimizations make it particularly well-suited for handling complex intellectual property (IP) data structures in a cost-effective and scalable manner.

## Key Features

* **EVM Compatibility**: Full compatibility with Ethereum Virtual Machine
* **Optimized Data Structures**: Precompiled primitives for efficient IP graph traversal
* **Fast Finality**: CometBFT-based consensus layer for quick transaction finality
* **Modular Architecture**: Decoupled consensus from execution using Ethereum's Engine-API
