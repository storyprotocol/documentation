Each IP Asset will be registered as an NFT (ERC-721) on Story Protocol, and the same goes for licenses issued. The protocol was designed for maximum composability so each IP organization (franchise) can access the broader web3 ecosystem, including all the DeFi services already servicing NFT projects. 

Many possible services can be built on these assets, such as collateralized loans backed by NFT collectibles or licenses with intrinsic value (upfront payment) or royalty payment expectations, fractionalized ownership of super limited NFT collectibles from popular IP franchises, or crowdfunding/capital formation solutions. One attractive characteristic of IPs registered on Story is their duality as web3 native and real-world assets.
