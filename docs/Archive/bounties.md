## BOUNTY #1 (GENERAL TRACK)

### Bounty Title: 

Integrate Story Protocol in your dApp (General Track)

### Bounty Category

 Launch MVP on Testnet or Mainnet

### Bounty Description (max 250 chars): 

Integrate with Story Protocol and add decentralized Intellectual Property tracking, Licensing and royalties for any content. Get automatic tracking of attribution, derivative work, licensing and royalty payments on Story Protocol’s IP Graph.

### Prize Amount: $15K

### Winner Breakdown:

* $7,000 for top project, 

* $4,000 for second, 

* $2,000 for third, 

* $1,000 for fourth

* $1,000 for fifth

Story Protocol team reserves the right to reward less than the total number of awards or the award amount allocated for this track if submissions' quality doesn't meet the criteria.

### What is required to complete this bounty?

* Submissions must integrate with the Story Protocol smart contracts (whether core or periphery). At a bare minimum read on-chain state. Top prizes will prioritize submissions that extensively interact with Story Protocol through on-chain state writes and reads.

* Although all projects that integrate will qualify, judging will be based on how thoughtful the integration is and how centric Intellectual Property and native Story Protocol functionality is to the project. For example, a dApp fully focused on IP will have a higher chance of winning compared to a dApp that randomly calls a function just to qualify for the bounty. Be creative!

* We prefer usage that covers more functions in the protocol, from registration of IP to licensing.

### What does success look like? What are the possible features that we are looking for?

* Ideally a submission has a clear use-case for Story Protocol and is thoughtfully integrated such that it makes sense from both a technical and use-case perspective. 

* This bounty is not theme specific and therefore eligible for all ideas. For example (but not limited to): music licensing, photo library with built-in IP registration, LLM attribution and provenance, IP onboarding tools, IP marketplaces, short video remixing, collaborative platforms like GitHub for IP franchises, Webtoon/Wattpad with new monetization mechanism for creators, all the way to application contracts that interact with the protocol itself. We encourage novel ideas and usage of the protocol.

* Keep in mind Story Protocol is introducing a completely new layer to both web3 and web2: the layer of intellectual property, attribution and licensing – the opportunities are endless!

### UI/UX Design Requirements

* There are no explicit UI/UX design requirements, but judges will appreciate smooth UX flows that are focused around providing a magical user (and/or developer) experience. 

### Judging Criteria

* Functionality (either for users and/or developers)

* Creativity / novelty  (is this a new use-case or experience?)

* How focused the project is around Story Protocol (higher = better)

* Adoption possibilities it unlocks

* Technical implementation and degree of completion (i.e. functioning MVP)

### Why is this bounty important?

* The protocol is still in beta, and we will be working closely with all participating hackathon teams beyond the BUIDLathon itself. This is an opportunity to build the first integrations / infrastructure / tooling / products on the decentralized IP layer of the internet and work closely with the core protocol team in helping us shape the future.

* Story Protocol is more than a global IP repository, it is the foundation for the next era of human creativity - be part of the journey!

* There is a very high chance for follow up funding/grants if the project is high quality and the team members are keen to continue the journey to mainnet, including (but not limited to) being a launch partner for our mainnet release, Entrepreneur in Residence positions, etc. 

### Examples of use cases we are looking to solve:

* Examples include (but are not limited to): 

* Music Licensing

* Photo library with built-in IP registration, 

* Automatic LLM attribution and provenance, 

* IP onboarding tools, 

* IP marketplaces,

* Collaboration platforms like GitHub for IP franchises

* Content consumption platforms like Wattpad/Webtoon with new monetization mechanism for creators

* Short-video remixing with built-in IP registration, 

* Application contracts that interact with the protocol and unlock new functionality

* Tools to visualize the IP graph

* Customized smart contracts that use the building blocks of the protocol

* SocialFi with native IP integration, registration, and remixing
