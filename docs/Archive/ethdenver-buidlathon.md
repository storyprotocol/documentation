## Quickstarts

The best way to get started is to go through the tutorials. We prepared two tutorial tracks that will help you grasp Story Protocol concepts as fast as possible and get you building right away. 

1. If you are a dApp builder who wants to read/write from Story Protocol in your web app, start with: [Get started with the SDK](doc:get-started-with-the-typescript-sdk). We have both a TypeScript and React SDK available.
   1. We also have a reference example **[Make NFT Story](https://github.com/storyprotocol/story-examples/tree/main/make-nft-story)**
2. If you are a Smart Contract developer who wants to integrate directly with the protocol, and create frontend contracts, start with: [Get started with the Smart Contracts](doc:get-started-with-the-smart-contracts)
3. If you mainly want to query data from the protocol, use the API, see [Getting Started](ref:story-protocol-api-reference), or jump right in and make your first call, e.g. [Get an IPAsset](ref:get_api-v1-assets-assetid)
4. To help you in your development, visit the [Story Protocol Explorer](https://explorer.storyprotocol.xyz/) to view your transactions on the protocol.

##  Beyond the Hackathon

### Builder Program

Story Protocol’s Builder Program supports, mentors, and nurtures current and upcoming projects built on Story Protocol. We will provide technical expertise, marketing know-how, potential grants, and investor networks introductions matching the level of ambition and execution capability of each project. If you're a visionary builder already working on or planning to build a project on top of Story Protocol, we want to talk to you.
