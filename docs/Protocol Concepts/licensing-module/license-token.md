A **License Token** is represented as an **ERC-721 NFT** and contains the specific [License Terms](doc:license-terms) it represents. Its associated `licenseTokenId` is global, as there is one License Token contract.

Once License Terms are attached to an IP Asset, it becomes public so that anyone can mint a License Token for those terms. A License Token is burned when it is used to register another IP as a derivative of the original IP Asset.

## Private Licenses

In order to mint a private License Token, the owner of a root IP Asset can issue License Tokens that have terms **not yet attached to the IP Asset itself**. It is important to also note that derivative IP Assets cannot issue private licenses because it is restricted to only issue licenses of its inherited terms.

## Transferability of the License Token

License Tokens might be transferrable or not, depending on the values of the License Terms terms they point to.

Once a non-transferable License Token is minted to a recipient, it is locked there forever.

## Registering a Derivative

There are two ways to register a derivative IP Asset.

> ðŸ“˜ Small Note
>
> An IP Asset can only register as a derivative one time. If an IP Asset has multiple parents, it must register both at the same time. Once an IP Asset is a derivative, it cannot link any more parents.

### 1. Using an Existing License Token

A License Token is burned when it is used to register another IP as a derivative of the original IP Asset.

### 2. Registering a Derivative Directly

You can also register a derivative directly, without the need for a License Token. Remember that if License Terms are attached to an IP Asset it is public to mint the License Token anyway, so this is simply a convenient way to go about it, thus skipping the middle step of minting a License Token.
