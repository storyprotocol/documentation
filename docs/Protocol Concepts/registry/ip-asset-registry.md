The IP Asset Registry is responsible for registering IPs into the protocol. It deploys a dedicated [IP Account](doc:ip-account) contract for each new IP Asset registered on the protocol (*NOTE: This registry inherits from IP Account Registry*)

### Notable Functions

```sol IPAssetRegistry.sol
function register(uint256 chainid, address tokenContract, uint256 tokenId) external whenNotPaused returns (address id)
```

This function registers an ERC-721 NFT as a new IP Asset on Story.
