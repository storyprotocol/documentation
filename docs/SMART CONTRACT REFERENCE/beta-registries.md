A registry is a contract that serves as the source of truth for Story Protocol regarding its associated data. For instance, IPAssetRegistry is the source of truth for all IPs registered in Story Protocol.

A registry is made to be an entry point for any external contract calls; it routes all calls to modules with internal business logic to serve its requirements.
